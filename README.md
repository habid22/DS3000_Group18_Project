# DS3000_Group18_Project
## This project involves predicting a person’s risk of diabetes based on a collection of medical data and symptoms. Diabetes affects many people across the globe, and being able to detect someone’s risk could help them prevent or treat it. This project aims to be an efficient and easy way to detect this risk, which would allow doctors to treat diabetes early.
